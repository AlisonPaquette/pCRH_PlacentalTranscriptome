Code for Manuscript: Associations between Maternal Plasma concentrations of Placental Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (pCRH) in mid-late Pregnancy and the Placental Transcriptome


Code 1: Describes the steps I took to clean the data recieved by the ECHO PATHWAYS data team

Code 2: Describes the differential gene expression analysis using EdgeR and the Pathway Analysis

Code 3: This is the code used to perform the TF enrichment. In this analysis, I used the PlacentalTRN, which is currently published in bioRxiv and has been accepted in Science Advances.

Code 4: This is the code that I used to perform the Mediation Analysis

This manuscript uses transcriptomic data (Which is available on DBGAP), Ancestry data that was derived from GWAS, and covariate data, all within the CANDLE cohort. We would not be able to share the raw data of the GWAS study itself or Covariate data on a public repository based on the data sharing guidelines of the parent cohort (CANDLE). This cohort is a vulnerable population of participants that self-report their race as Black and are from a limited geographic area (Memphis Tennessee), which raises privacy concerns. I have reviewed your submission guidelines and I believe that this would need to be subjected to Controlled Acccess. CANDLE has specific guidelines about data access and publications policies that are available on the Cohort website. Other data collected from CANDLE participants generated as part of ECHO PATHWAYS is available upon reasonable request, in alignment with ECHO PATHWAYS collaboration guidelines (LeWinn et al. 2022).
